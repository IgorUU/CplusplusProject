# C++ Tutorial

## Getting started

We will use VScode as our IDE of choice.

They transform our code into a format that can run directly on the hardware we will need compilers.
**Which compiler are we going to use depends on the operating system we are working in**.
As we our working in Ubuntu (Linux), we are going to use these 2 compilers:
- Gcc
- Clang llvm
